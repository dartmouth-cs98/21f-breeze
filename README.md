![Team Photo](./groupPhoto.jpg)

Welcome to Breeze! We are an iOS app that helps you build good habits in your social media use. Set time limits on various apps and Breeze will send you push notifications reminding you to leave the app. The more often you click on the notifications, the faster your ship sails along the sea!

## Architecture

Breeze is an iOS app. To build, we are using a stack of Swift, Xcode, Realm DB, Apple ScreenTime API, Family Activity Picker, and Apple Spritekit.

## Setup

For now, open up the project in XCode and hit play.

## Deployment

Testflight coming soon for deployment!
