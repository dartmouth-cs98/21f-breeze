# Breeze

Welcome to Breeze! We are an iOS app designed to help you reduce your screentime with positive reinforcement. Users can set a total screen time limit, and Breeze will send a notification invitation to our game when users meet that limit. Accepting these notifications means progressing farther in the game and discovering new islands!

## Architecture
Breeze is an iOS app developed in Xcode 13, written with Swift 5 and Apple SpriteKit.

## Deployment
Breeze is designed to run on an iPhone with iOS 14.4 or greater.

Download our app on the Apple App Store: _TODO_ *link*

Currently, testing access to Breeze is run through Apple TestFlight. Please contact one of the authors of this app if you wish to have access.

To deploy from this repository:
1. With a MacOS supported device with Xcode installed, clone this repository locally.
2. Connect an iOS supported device-preferably an iPhone-to the computer. Xcode iOS simulators are not able to mimick the CoreMortion game behavior.
3. At the top of the Xcode window, there should be a drop down menu with device options for building the app. Select the plugged in device and build!

Thank you Tim Tregubov and the Dartmouth College Department of Computer Science for giving us the time and space in our coursework to problem solve issues we all personally face and pursue our development interests!
